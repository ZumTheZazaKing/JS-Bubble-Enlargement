something I made using JavaScript's onmouseover DOM event

i kind of got bored so I decided to play around with JavaScript's onmouseover DOM event

and then I made this

not really useful but quite good for practice

maybe it can be improved

who knows?

anyways,

you can edit the code and request a pull from me
